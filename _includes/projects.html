                        <p>
						 I am currently working on an AR/VR Mobile and WebGL APP which support users to download 3D models from server and view and manipulate the furniture data and models in AR and VR environment. By having furnitures (sold from an actual e-commerce site) loaded into mobile AR and WebGL VR environment in time, it allows buyers to evaluate furnitures before making purchase. The WebGL APP also provides VR functions that allow users to create and edit 2D blueprint, and it can automatically convert 2D blueprints of a ﬂoor plan into 3D room environment that interior designers can get real-time feedback about their design. The application also supports inapp purchase of furnitures via its remote shopping cart functions. I used Unity3D, Kudan, AR Kit, AR Core in the project, with C# as the main programming language. I was the developer lead in the project.
