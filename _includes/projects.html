						 I am currently working on an AR/VR Mobile and WebGL APP which support users to download 3D models from server and view and manipulate the furniture data and models in AR and VR environment. By having furnitures (sold from an actual e-commerce site) loaded into mobile AR and WebGL VR environment in time, it allows buyers to evaluate furnitures before making purchase. The WebGL APP also provides VR functions that allow users to create and edit 2D blueprint, and it can automatically convert 2D blueprints of a ﬂoor plan into 3D room environment that interior designers can get real-time feedback about their design. The application also supports inapp purchase of furnitures via its remote shopping cart functions. I used Unity3D, Kudan, AR Kit, AR Core in the project, with C# as the main programming language. I was the developer lead in the project.

							I designed and implemented IntelliK, a game design application which can provide user who has no programming background with the capability of developing diﬀerent games eﬃciently and eﬀectively. Using Game Designer, user can design and develop diﬀerent kinds of games. This application is ﬂexible and pluggable, with diﬀerent kinds of the plug in (such as runtime control script editor, tile-map editor, decision making AI editor, etc.), users can create powerful and complex games. As the eﬀective of the Deep learning plugin, it supports users to embed machine learning applications (including but not limited to face veriﬁcation and recognition and reinforcement learning) within games. With the data analytics plugin, it allow game creators to deﬁne the data they want to collect streaming data for game analytics. Server for the game designer: I implemented a server for the game designer which supports users to upload / download / add reviews to games. It also contains a content management system that allow administrators to create/edit contents and event triggers. Users can ﬁnd the collection and analytics data of their games from this website. Mobile APP of the game loader: This APP allow users to download and play the games which is created by the game designer from server. Features such as video recording, sharing, chatting, data collection and multi-play as included as well. I was the developer lead of the project. In this project, I used a number of technologies including Unity3D for 3D modelling and visualization, Spring Boot for the backend, Vue + iView for the frontend, OpenCV for the object detection, Tensorflow for the deep learning face verification and recognition

						My master work on multi-agent system is an innovative game and simulation AI that uses SARSA (state-action-reward-state-action), Q-Learn and Fuzzy ART (Adaptive Resonance Theory) network for temporal diﬀerence (TD) reinforcement learning among game agents whose collaborative behavior are supervised via crowd-AI including ant colony system, particle warm, ﬂocking and steering behaviors. The group behavior AI is able to allow cooperative learning between multi agents in a game or simulation environment. The project was written in Java and Swing

						I designed and implemented a unity application to get series of screen captures for robot motions which follow the result of the FAME library. FAME is a ﬂocking library which can generate location of each agent in ﬂock of every frame. This unity application can generates realistic ﬂocking motion (based on the FAME library) and control each characters’ action by the input commands. Then it can automatically do the screen captures to get series pictures which would use to generate videos. The project was written in C# and Unity3D

						MAZE is a 3D game research project which inspires from visual programming concept that let users create and design their own maze game by manipulating game characters and objects graphically. It allows users to create their own maze game environment in Maze Editor. It also provides Script Maze Editor to deﬁne and design the action scripts to control the behaviors of game character. Moreover, user can examine the ability of his/her own game character in other maze game environment created by another user. I was the developer lead, the project was written in C# and Unity3D

						AIRDesigner (AI Rule Designer) comes with a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art AI technologies including expert system, decision tree, behavior tree, fuzzy rule and state machine. Through the lego-like graphical building blocks , user can design the behaviors of game character seamlessly via a series of drag and drop functionality. This allows even non-programmers such as game designers to define, design and modify the AI rules of game characters quickly. Moreover, AIRDesigner can be contributed as part of the game to provide human player with the capability of defining decision process and behaviors of game characters.
